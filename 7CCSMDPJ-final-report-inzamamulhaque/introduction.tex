\section{Introduction}

\emph{The Introduction is the first content section of your report. You should describe the general area (e.g., application domain) in which your project research is conducted, the motivation for conducting the research and the overall aims of the research. Be sure to outline your research questions and give a brief summary of the conclusions drawn, though the conclusions will be detailed later in the report. With the Introduction, you want to interest your reader and tell them why they should care about your research and why they should read the rest of the report. The report will be read (marked) by examiners with a technical Computer Science background, but not necessarily any knowledge of your domain, so make sure that you provide enough information for a naive reader.}

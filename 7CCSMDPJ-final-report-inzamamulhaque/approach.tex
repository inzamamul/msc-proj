\section{Approach} 

\emph{The Approach section of your report should describe what you did. You should discuss your research questions in detail here, explaining for each question how you addressed each question (i.e., what techniques you used) and how you evaluated the success (or failure) of your investigation. This should include a description of the data set(s) that you used for your research (e.g., what you included in your Data Acquisition report that was due in March).}

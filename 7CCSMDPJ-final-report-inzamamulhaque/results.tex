\section{Results} 

\emph{The Results section of your report basically contains the answers to your research questions. This section should present the results of your evaluation, provided quantitatively, qualitatively and/or visually, as appropriate, followed by an analysis of the results. Discuss with your project supervisor(s) and/or domain advisor(s) how best to present your results. The main point is to make sure that it is clear to the reader what the answers to your research questions are and how you arrived at these answers.}

I would like to thank my supervisors Dr. Davide Danovi, Dr. Amos Folarin and of course Dr. Nishanth Nastry, for their incredible support and patience that was conveyed throughout this project process. I would also like to thank my close friends and family for supporting me throughout this project and my life thus far, and I hope for their continued warm support going forward.

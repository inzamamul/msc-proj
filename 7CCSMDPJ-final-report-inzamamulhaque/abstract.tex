\emph{This thesis looks at utilising Google TensorFlow's machine learning library to try and classify stem cells. Images were recorded hourly over 24 hours of cell wells containing stem cells from anonomous donors that had been exposed to various concentrations of protein. The raw images of the cell wells were processed and masked in order to segment the individual stem cells from the raw images. Stem cells that were segmented from the first raw image captured in the 24 hour period were labelled as 'normal', i.e. cells which had not yet been affected by the protein concentrations. \\ \\  These individual stem cells were then trained upon by a convolutional neural network, in order to be able to predict and classify whether a new unseen stem cells was 'normal' or 'abnormal', or in other words, whether or not a stem cell had been affected by the protein concentrations. Using the count of 'normal' and 'abnormal' stem cells in a specific hour of the experiment, we are able to identify interesting metrics to assign to the activity levels of the cells exposed to varying levels of protein. }

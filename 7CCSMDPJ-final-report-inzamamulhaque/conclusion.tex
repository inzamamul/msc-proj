\section{Conclusion}

\emph{
I'm fucked lol. \\ \\ 
The Conclusion is the last section of your report (other than Appendixes). In this section, you can revisit the research questions and summarise your answers. Clearly explain how your investigation and your answers are a contribution---why your work is worthy of a passing mark. Also in the Conclusion section, it is good to have subsections that highlight (a) Future Work, in case you were going to keep working on the same line of research or you wanted to recommend follow-up investigation for another student to pursue next year; and (b) Lessons Learned, where you can explain how you might do things differently if you started over, because you've learned valuable things along the way (these could be technical, but they could also be personal, such as organising your time better or listening to the project coordinator who told you to BACK UP your work frequently).}
